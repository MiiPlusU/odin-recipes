        <p>
            Here’s the good news: perfect hard boiled eggs are easy to make. 
            …And the bad news: so are less-than-perfect ones. 
            I don’t know about you, but I’ve certainly cooked my fair share of the latter. 
            When you try to peel away the shell, half the whites come along with it, or when you cut it open, the yolk is slightly green instead of brilliant yellow. 
            Pretty disappointing, if you ask me.

            See, cooking perfect hard boiled eggs is easy, but that doesn’t mean that the process you use doesn’t matter. 
            After years of trial and error, I’m happy to say that this method for how to make hard boiled eggs works every time! 
            The yolks are always sunshine yellow, and the shells slide right off.

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place eggs in a medium pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. 
                Bring to a boil, then cover the pot and turn off the heat. 
                Let the eggs cook, covered, for 9 to 12 minutes, depending on your desired done-ness (see photo).
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water and chill for 14 minutes. 
                This makes the eggs easier to peel. Peel and enjoy!
